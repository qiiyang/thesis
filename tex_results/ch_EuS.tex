As discussed in section~\ref{sec:ti}, two crucial ingredients to study time-reversal symmetry breaking in a topological insulator are a spontaneous magnetic order, and good electric insulation. In addition to the present purpose, a variety of applications, including spintronics, and $\pi$-Josephson junctions for quantum qubits~\cite{pi_qubit, pi_junction, Wolf2001, EuS_spin_filter, EuS_app1, EuS_spin_filter2}, also require fabrication of high-quality thin films with both robust magnetic properties and highly insulating behavior. Materials with both spontaneous magnetization and insulating behavior are often interchangeably referred to as ``magnetic insulators'' or ``magnetic semiconductors''. Among these materials, many are ferrimagnets. Such examples include magnetite (Fe$_3$O$_4$, Curie temperature $T_C\approx850~\mathrm{K}$)~\cite{Neel1948}, and yittrium-iron garnet (``YIG'', Y$_3$Fe$_2$(FeO$_4$)$_3$, $T_C\approx550~\mathrm{K}$)~\cite{YIG}. In such case, the net spontaneous magnetization is formed by opposite but unequal magnetic lattices, therefore the surface of these material might consist of alternating opposite magnetic domains, which would complicate the interface to a topological insulator. Insulating ferromagnets, on the other hand, only have a small number of candidate materials available.

Two of the first known insulating ferromagnets are the europium(II) chalcogenides EuO and EuS. Divalent compounds of europium with elements of the sixth group (O, S, Se, Te) exhibit a rock-salt (NaCl) type crystal structure with ordered magnetic states at low temperatures. As the lattice parameter increases from EuO to EuTe, a ferromagnetically ordered state of moments localized on Eu$^{2+}$ ions appear in EuO ($T_C\approx69~\mathrm{K}$) and in EuS ($T_C\approx16.5~\mathrm{K}$)~\cite{EuO_TC, EuS_Shafer, EuS_specific_heat}, while EuSe and EuTe show collinear antiferromagnetic ordering with N\'eel temperatures $T_N\approx4.2~\mathrm{K}$, $T_N\approx9.8~\mathrm{K}$ respectively~\cite{EuSe_AF, EuTe_AF}. In these chalcogenide compounds, the localized isotropic $L=0$ ground state ($^8S_{7/2}$) of Eu$^{2+}$ ions and their simple face centered cubic (FCC) magnetic lattice make them prime candidates to test the Heisenberg model of local-moment magnetism and theories of critical phenomena~\cite{divalent_Eu, EuX_indirect_exchange, EuS_neighbor_exchange, EuS_critical, EuS_neutron, EuS_spin_wave}.

Between the two ferromagnets, EuS is favored over EuO for our purposes. Firstly, the properties of EuS has been more thoroughly studied experimentally due to better sample qualities achieved in the past~\cite{EuS_band_th2}. Furthermore, the relatively low Curie temperature of EuS would allow switching on and off its ferromagnetism at low temperatures, when changes in quantum phenomena are more likely observable due to reduced thermal motions. Finally, considering the material systems to interface with in later chapters, namely Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and (Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_2$Te$_3$, and potential unintended anion substitution at the interface: Bi$_2$Te$_{1.6}$S$_{1.4}$ was shown to be a topological insulator itself~\cite{BiTeS}, therefore should introduce minimum complication; whereas Bi$_2$Se$_2$S is a fully gapped trivial insulator~\cite{BiSeS}, therefore at least should not introduce exotic transport properties on its own. Therefore, EuS will be the focus of the rest of this chapter.

\section{Reported Properties of Crystals and Thin Films}\label{sec:EuS_previous}
EuS has a crystal parameter $a_0=5.967~\mathrm\AA$~\cite{EuS_Shafer}, and exhibits an indirect gap of 1.65~eV between the valence band maximum at the $\Gamma$ point (Brillouin zone center) and the conduction band minimum at the X point ([100] Brillouin zone boundary)~\cite{EuX_absorption, EuS_band_th1, EuS_band_th2}. High quality stoichiometric single crystals of EuS exhibit Curie temperatures around $T_C\approx16.5~\mathrm{K}$, and good electric insulation with resistivity values $\rho\approx10~\Omega\cdot\mathrm{cm}$ at room temperature and $\rho\approx10^4~\Omega\cdot\mathrm{cm}$ at $T=135~\mathrm{K}$~\cite{EuS_Shafer}. However, when excessive electrons are present, either by intentional doping or due to difficulties in material fabrication, such as sulfur deficiency and crystal defects, the resistivity may be drastically reduced by n-type conduction to as low as $\rho\approx10^{-2}~\Omega\cdot\mathrm{cm}$, both at room temperature and at low temperatures~\cite{EuS_LaDoped, EuS_ntype}. Such reduction in resistivity was found to be universally accompanied by increased Curie temperatures (up to $T_C\approx30~\mathrm{K}$) due to interactions between charge carriers and the Eu$^{2+}$ ions~\cite{EuS_TC_doping, EuS_ntype, EuX_doped_transport, EuX_RKKY}. On the other hand, cases of p-type conduction in EuS has not been reported, presumably due to the readily available Eu$^{3+}$ ionic state, cancelling the effect of any acceptor doping~\cite{EuX_doped_transport}.

In one and two dimensions, N. D. Mermin and H. Wagner predicted that neither ferromagnetism nor antiferromagnetism can exist at any non-zero temperature within an isotropic Heisenberg model~\cite{Mermin1966}. From 3D crystals to thin films, namely crossing over from three to two dimensions, one may therefore expect the Curie temperature of an isotropic Heisenberg ferromagnet to decrease as the thickness decreases. Indeed, such effect of dimensionality reduction has been investigated theoretically and observed experimentally~\cite{thickness_Tc_theory, thickness_Tc_exp}. Particularly for EuS, lower-than-bulk Curie temperatures were observed in thin films at the thicknesses $t < 6~\mathrm{nm}$~\cite{EuS_MBE_Muller}. However, above such thickness threshold, thin films fabricated by a variety of methods, such as electron beam evaporation, MBE, and PLD, often exhibited $T_C$ higher than single crystal values, which indicate significant n-type carrier doping~\cite{EuS_MBE_Muller, EuS_thin_film_Keller, EuS_PLD1, EuS_PLD2}. Additionally, these reported growth methods often resulted in samples with multiple crystal orientations, which might give rise to fractured magnetic domains given the considerable magnetocrystalline anisotropy of EuS~\cite{EuS_anisotropy}, that might in turn complicate further experiments.

The PLD procedure introduced in the next section has yield EuS thin films with significantly improved qualities. In particular, characterization results will be presented, indicating excellent electric insulation, a significant and uniform out-of-plane component of the magnetization, a single lattice orientation, and a near-ideal surface topography.

\section{Improved Pulsed Laser Deposition of Thin Films}\label{sec:EuSPLD}
For PLD targets, solid disks (approximately $19~\mathrm{mm}$ in diameter and $3~\mathrm{mm}$ thick) were prepared from high-purity (99.95\%) EuS powder by a fast consolidation technique popularly referred to as spark plasma sintering (SPS).\footnote{Target preparation was carried out by Jinfeng Zhao and Subhash H. Risbud at the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of California, Davis.} This technique uses an electric discharge to activate the surface of the powder particles prior to rapid resistance heating, aiming at achieving complete densification. SPS has been effectively used to make solid disk-like targets of a wide range of materials including chalcogenides~\cite{Jinfeng2, Subhash1}, and its efficiency in forming clean grain boundaries in polycrystalline targets has been shown for nitrides and refractory high-temperature materials~\cite{Subhash2, Jinfeng1}. The target surface was polished with a 800~grit diamond sandpaper before transferring to high vacuum. For final conditioning of the target surface and to deposit EuS thin films, the target was spun at 18 rpm and ablated by a 25~ns 248~nm KrF excimer pulsed laser beam in high vacuum ($p=6\times{}10^{-7}~\mathrm{Torr}$) at 10~Hz repetition rate. The typical ablation spot size was $2.1\pm0.3~\mathrm{mm^2}$ and the measured fluence was $1.0\pm0.2~\mathrm{J\cdot{}cm^{-2}}$. The ablation results in broad plumes a few centimeters in size. Corundum Al$_2$O$_3$ (0001) and Si (100) substrates were cleaned \textit{ex situ} by solvent sonication prior to transfer to high vacuum. The substrates were heated to $650~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and placed 5~cm away from the target at the center of the plasma plume. The growth rate was estimated to be 1.3~\AA{} per pulse. After each deposition, the substrates were cooled in vacuum to $60~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ with a rate no faster than $15~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$.

The resultant thin films with thicknesses $20~\mathrm{nm}<t<200~\mathrm{nm}$ have a translucent purple color on Al$_2$O$_3$ and are dark green on Si. Figure~\ref{fig:EuS_TEM} shows a transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of a thin film cross-section, where the FCC lattice of EuS can be clearly observed.\footnote{TEM was done by Ann F. Marshall at the Stanford Nanocharacterization Laboratory.} %

The lattice constant is estimated from direct length measurements to be $a=6.0\pm0.2~\mathrm\AA$, consistent with the established results~\cite{EuS_Shafer}. Surface topography was measured with an atomic force microscope (AFM). Figure~\ref{fig:EuS_AFM} shows a $1~\mathrm{\mu{}m}\times{}1\mathrm{\mu{}m}$ area on the surface of a 20~nm film on Al$_2$O$_3$. The difference between the minima and maxima in height is roughly twice the lattice constant. The root-mean-square roughness $\sigma=1.8~\mathrm\AA$ calculated from a randomly selected line profile indicates near-ideal smoothness. Similar smoothness were obtained on films with thicknesses up to 200~nm deposited on either Al$_2$O$_3$~(0001) or Si~(100).

(a)~On Al$_2$O$_3$ (0001) substrates, optimal growth conditions lead to a single (100) orientation, whereas multiple orientations were observed in non-optimal samples. Spikes near substrate peaks are due to the K-$\beta$ components of the X-ray source. (b)~On Si (100) substrates with native oxides, single (100) orientation was obtained at optimal growth conditions.

\end{figure} %
%
On both Al$_2$O$_3$ (0001) and Si (100) substrates, the optimal conditions described earlier produced samples with a single orientation where the [100] planes are parallel to the substrate surface. On Al$_2$O$_3$ (0001) substrates (figure~\ref{fig:EuS_XRD_sap}), the (200) and (400) reflections are easily identified whereas the (600) reflection is discernible from the background. On Si (100) substrates (figure~\ref{fig:EuS_XRD_Si}), all [100] reflections are clearly observable. For comparison, the diffraction pattern of a non-optimal sample deposited on Al$_2$O$_3$ (0001) at a lower temperature ($T=600~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$) was plotted in figure~\ref{fig:EuS_XRD_sap}. Reflections from both the [100] and the [111] orientations were observed with comparable weights. Similar multiple orientations were observed in samples deposited at higher-than-optimal temperatures ($T>700~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$) or higher ambient pressures ($p>2\times{}10^{-6}~\mathrm{Torr}$).

The resistances of the EuS thin films were measured with the van der Pauw technique (\textit{q.v.} section~\ref{sec:vdp})~\cite{VdP1958}. When deposited at the optimal conditions on either Al$_2$O$_3$ (0001) or Si (100) substrates, samples with thicknesses $20~\mathrm{nm}<t<200~\mathrm{nm}$ all show sheet resistances $R_\Box>20~\mathrm{M\Omega}$ at temperatures $T > 100~\mathrm{K}$, and immeasurably  high resistance at lower temperatures. This is equivalent to bulk resistivity exceeding  $\rho>400~\mathrm{\Omega\cdot{}cm}$, consistent to values obtained on high-purity single crystals~\cite{EuS_Shafer}. In contrast, films deposited at non-optimal conditions show sheet resistances as low as $R_\Box\sim~\mathrm{k\Omega}$ (figure~\ref{fig:EuS_RvT}), %

(b)~These non-optimal samples show negative giant magnetoresistance at $T=2~\mathrm{K}$, similar to that observed in n-type single crystals.}%
\end{figure}%
%
which corresponds to a bulk resistivity of $\rho\sim10^{-2}\mathrm{\Omega\cdot{}cm}$, consistent with the conductive r\'egime in doped single crystals~\cite{EuS_ntype}. Different from n-type single crystals results, where resistance anomalies were observed near $T_C$ and attributed to change in carrier concentrations~\cite{EuS_ntype, EuX_doped_transport}, monotonic increases in resistance were observed towards low temperatures in thin films. Such difference could be resulted from different natures of dopants or due to the effects of reduced dimensionality~\cite{2D_conduction}. Similar to n-type doped single crystals, negative giant magnetoresistance was observed in the conducting samples at low temperatures (figure~\ref{fig:EuS_RvH}).

Magnetizations of the thin films were measured in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer down to $T=2~\mathrm{K}$. A significant perpendicular component of the magnetization was observed (figure~\ref{fig:EuS_MvH_z}), whereas the easy axes are in the sample plane (figure~\ref{fig:EuS_MvH_x}).%

While the coercive field of perpendicular magnetization may vary within the same order of magnitude for film thicknesses between 20~nm and 200~nm, the general hysteresis features are similar for all our samples on either Al$_2$O$_3$ (0001) or Si (100). By fitting to the Curie-Weiss law in the paramagnetic regime (figure~\ref{fig:EuS_MvT_z}), an upper limit of the Curie temperature of an optimal 20~nm thin film on Al$_2$O$_3$ (0001) was estimated to be $T_C=15.9~\mathrm{K}$. As discussed earlier in section~\ref{sec:EuS_previous}, a low $T_C$ is expected for thin film samples with diminishing carrier densities~\cite{EuS_TC_doping, EuS_ntype, EuX_doped_transport, thickness_Tc_theory, thickness_Tc_exp}. Compared to the lowest $T_C$ recorded of high-quality single crystals ($T_C\approx16.5~\mathrm{K}$), the lower $T_C$ is an indication of high thin film qualities.

To test for homogeneity of the magnetism in our films we used a scanning Sagnac interferometer.\footnote{Scanning Sagnac interferometry measurements were performed and analyzed by Alexander Fried.} This device is based on a zero-area loop Sagnac interferometer that was first demonstrated by \citeauthor{Xia2006}~\cite{Xia2006}, and can measure the Polar Kerr angle upon reflection from the film with shot-noise limited sensitivity at low power. Our scanning device is operated at a wavelength of 820~nm, and has a spatial resolution of 0.9~$\mu$m. Figure~\ref{fig:EuS_Sagnac} shows several line scans of length~100 $\mu$m, taken at a temperature of 10~K and at low magnetic fields, showing a very uniform Kerr response. This set of line scans also agrees with the coercive field found in the SQUID magnetometry measurements.

While the experimental setup for PLD is relatively simple, it is well known that complex and non-equilibrium mechanisms are involved in both laser ablation of the target and plume-substrate interactions (\textit{q.v.} section~\ref{sec:pld}). Here we present a tentative discussion on the growth process. At the optimal growth conditions, the resultant atomically smooth topography seems to suggest the Frank--van der Merwe mode of nucleation. The absence of microstructures, which indicates sufficient reduction of partial evaporation (``splashing'')~\cite{PLD_book}, may have been in part due to the effective densification with the SPS technique and appropriate target surface treatment. While EuS solid is stable up to $2300~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in vacuum~\cite{EuS_phase_diagram}, we found that the film quality is sensitive to relatively small deviations ($\Delta{}T=\pm50~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$) from the optimal substrate temperature $T=650~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. Lowering the substrate temperature or increasing the ambient pressure are known to increase the cooling rate of adatoms. Since the constituent elements of EuS have a large difference in vapor pressures: $p(\mathrm{S})/p(\mathrm{Eu})>10^4$ at $T=650~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$~\cite{elements}, Such effects might worsen both stoichiometry and structure~\cite{Metev1988}. In addition, the detrimental effects of changing temperature at either directions may be related to the nearby eutectic point at $750~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and the EuS$_2$ phase below $575~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$~\cite{EuS_phase_diagram}, which may provide transient states that facilitate structural distortions or an Eu-rich stoichiometry. In either case, the distortion in stoichiometry would likely result in unintended doping.

To further illustrate the improvements over previously samples, particularly in the context of our present application, the Curie temperatures and room temperature resistivity of reported samples are compared in table~\ref{tab:EuS_comparison}.%

While previous research often focused on the magnetic properties of EuS thin films and left their resistivity unreported, the expected electric properties may be inferred from the Curie temperatures by considering the known effects of reduced dimensionality and excessive carriers. As discussed in section~\ref{sec:EuS_previous}, the former lowers the Curie temperature of EuS, whereas the latter increases the Curie temperature, therefore high quality insulating thin films of EuS should exhibit lower Curie temperatures than their crystalline counterparts. However, with exception of the \citeauthor{EuS_MBE_Dauth}~\citeyear{EuS_MBE_Dauth} case, all previous thin films samples have Curie temperatures higher than the stoichiometric single crystal value, therefore likely have considerable electric conduction similar to the n-type doped crystals. In contrast, the EuS thin films obtained by our improved PLD recipe exhibit Curie temperatures that are lower than bulk crystal values, and insulating behavior that is similar to high quality stoichiometric single crystals.

So far in this chapter, the focus has been on the properties of EuS thin films. The perpendicular component of spontaneous magnetization was demonstrated by SQUID magnetometry (figure~\ref{fig:EuS_MvH_z}), the homogeneity of the perpendicular magnetization by scanning Sagnac interferometry (figure~\ref{fig:EuS_Sagnac}), the surface smoothness by AFM (figure~\ref{fig:EuS_AFM}), and electric insulation by resistivity measurements. Having established these properties of EuS thin films, henceforth in the following chapters, experiments will be presented with two different topological insulators interfacing with EuS.
