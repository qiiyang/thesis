Given the spin-momentum locking in the surface states, the electric conduction in topological insulator thin films is typically discussed in literature in terms of the weak antilocalization effect. While the weak antilocalization explains well the positive magnetoresistance that is ubiquitously observed in topological insulator thin films, two discrepancies have been observed at low temperatures. Firstly, the weak antilocalization effect should increase the conductivity as the temperature is lowered~\cite{bergmann1984}; however, a reduction of conductivity is observed often in thin films with thicknesses $\lesssim 10~\mathrm{nm}$, with the conductivity varies logarithmically with the temperature~\cite{Chen2011, Liu2011, Roy2013}, similarly to that described by the weak localization (the opposite) effect (equation~\ref{eq:wl_T}). This has been attributed to the effect of electron-electron interaction in the diffusive r\'egime in two dimensions~\cite{WL_ee}. Secondly, the weak antilocalization effect is applicable only when the sheet resistance is much below the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit in two-dimensions ($R_\Box \ll h/e^2$, \textit{q.v.} section~\ref{sec:wl}); however, the resistance of topological insulator thin films sometimes approaches or exceeds such limit~\cite{TI_WAL_thickness, ZhangJS2011}.

In chapter~\ref{ch:bilayer2018}, we remarked that such high resistance ($R_\Box \gtrsim h/e^2$) was othe commonality amongst TI-ferromagnet thin film bilayers that show negative magnetoresistance (figure~\ref{fig:bilayer2018_wl_trend}). After the publication of \cite{bilayer2018}, we were brought to attention to ref.~\cite{liao2015}, in which \citeauthor{liao2015} analyzed the temperature dependence of resistance of \SI{2}{nm} (Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films, demonstrating that by reducing the thicknesses of thin films, electric conduction undergoes a crossover from the diffusive r\'egime with electron-electron interaction to the variable-range hopping r\'egime. These suggest that the temperature dependence of resistance should be similarly analyzed for the thin film samples in this thesis that approach or exceed the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit.

Both topological insulator materials presented in this thesis should be considered doped semiconductors. In the case of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, perfect crystalline samples should have a Fermi level in the bulk band gap~\cite{TI_electronic_structure_zhang}; whereas as-made thin films typically exhibit elevated Fermi levels that intersect with the bulk conduction band, primarily due to interstitials and vacancies~\cite{TI_ARPES1, ARPES_thickness, zhangli2013, Zhanybek3, Fisher2010}. In the case of (Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_2$Te$_3$, on the other hand, the difference between the ionization energy of Bi$^{3+}$ and that of Sb$^{3+}$ is utilized to move the Fermi level into the bulk band gap, typically with Bi$^{3+}$ serving as substitutional dopants~\cite{ZhangJS2011, TI_electronic_structure_zhang}.

The electric conduction modes in doped semiconductors discussed in ref~\cite{schklovskii_efros} and section~\ref{sec:vrh} are, therefore, relevant to the thin film samples in this thesis. Here we will test four conduction models against the temperature dependence of resistance of our samples: the diffusive conduction with electron-electron interaction (EE) that was found relevant in refs.~\cite{Chen2011, Liu2011, Roy2013, liao2015}, both Mott type and Efros-Shklovskii type variable-range hopping (VRH) models, as well a thermal activation model that might describe the crossover between the variable-range hopping and fully diffusive r\'egimes (equation~\ref{eq:activation}, and ref.~\cite{schklovskii_efros}: chapter 4). The temperature dependence of sheet conductivity resulted from these models in two-dimensions are discussed in section~\ref{sec:vrh}, and summarized below in equations~\ref{eq:modes}:%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:modes}
    \sigma_\Box(T) \propto %
    \begin{cases}
        \log(T / T_0)  & \quad \text{(diffusive with EE, \cite{WL_ee})}\\
        e^{-\frac{\varepsilon_1}{k_B T}}   & \quad \text{(thermal activation, equation~\ref{eq:activation})}\\
        e^{-\left(\frac{T}{T_0}\right)^{-\frac{1}{3}}}   & \quad \text{(Mott type VRH, equation~\ref{eq:vrh_mott})}\\
        e^{-\left(\frac{T}{T_0}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}} & \quad \text{(Efros-Shklovskii type VRH, equation~\ref{eq:vrh_efros})}~.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}%

To test how well each of these models describes the temperature dependence of the thin film samples presented in earlier chapters, the equations~\ref{eq:modes} are linearized into the form $y=ax+b$ (table~\ref{tab:models}), and the relevance of each model should be reflected in the linearity in its respective data plots.%

\section{Bi$_2$Se$_3$--EuS Bilayers and Bi$_2$Se$_3$ Thin Films}
In this section, the models listed in table~\ref{tab:models} will be tested against the temperature dependence of the resistance of the Bi$_2$Se$_3$--EuS bilayers, and Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin films without EuS, presented in chapter~\ref{ch:bilayer2014}. Descriptions of these samples are reiterated in table~\ref{tab:models_bl2014}, with remarks on whether a negative magnetoresistance ($-$ve MR) was observed in each sample.%

The models are first compared for the four Bi$_2$Se$_3$--EuS bilayer samples that showed negative magnetoresistance below the Curie temperature of EuS (BL1--3, figure~\ref{fig:models_bls}).%
\begin{figure}[ht]%

\end{figure} %
%
These samples all have the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ layers around \SI{3}{nm} thick, and showed sheet resistance comparable to the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit at room temperature: $R_\Box(T=300~\mathrm{K}) \sim h/e^2$. Their sheet resistance increases at low temperatures, becoming up to two orders of magnitude higher resistance at $T = 2~\mathrm{K}$. Among the four models, the diffusive model with electron-electron interaction (figure~\ref{fig:models_bls}a), and the thermal activation model (figure~\ref{fig:models_bls}b) do not display a clear linearity in any significant temperature range. Between the variable-range hopping models (figures~\ref{fig:models_bls}c~\&~d), the Efros-Shklovskii type seems to fit in a wide temperature range $3~\mathrm{K} \lesssim T \lesssim 100~\mathrm{K}$. Below $T \approx 3~\mathrm{K}$, the samples show resistance values that deviate from each other, and from the Efros-Shklovskii model. This is possibly an artefact introduced by inhomogeneity in sample thickness, as discussed in chapter~\ref{ch:bilayer2014}.

The Bi$_2$Se$_3$--EuS bilayer sample, BL0, has a \SI{5}{nm} Bi$_2$Se$_3$ layer, and only showed positive magnetoresistance (figure~\ref{fig:TI0_MR}). Its sheet resistance is near the the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit for the entire $2~\mathrm{k} < T < 300~\mathrm{K}$. In this sample, the comparison is less clear (figure~\ref{fig:models_bl0}).%

Both the diffusive model with electron-electron interaction (b) and Efros-Shklovskii type variable-range hopping (d) seem to describe the low-temperature parts of the data reasonably well.}%
\end{figure} %
%
Both the thermal activation model (figure~\ref{fig:models_bl0}b) and Efros-Shklovskii type variable-range hopping (figure~\ref{fig:models_bl0}d) seem to describe the low-temperature parts of the data ($T \lesssim 30~\mathrm{K}$ and $T \lesssim 10~\mathrm{K}$, respectively) reasonably well. This might be an indication that, as the thickness increases, this sample resides within the cross-over between the variable-range hopping and the diffusive conduction r\'egimes.

The Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin films on Al$_2$O$_3$~(0001) without EuS, TI0 and TI3, have considerably lower sheet resistance than that of their bilayer counterparts BL0 and BL3 (figure~\ref{fig:models_tis_rt}).%

\end{figure} %
%
The resistance of the \SI{5}{nm} Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin film, TI0, is an order of magnitude below the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit, that decreases as the temperature lowers (figure~\ref{fig:models_tis_rt}a). Therefore none of the models in table~\ref{tab:models} applies for TI0. The resistance of the \SI{3}{nm} film, TI3, on the other hand, is near the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit, and increases at lower temperatures. The respective data plots of the models for TI3 are shown in figure~\ref{fig:models_ti3}.%

While both types of variable-range hopping models seem to display reasonable linearity, the Efros-Shklovskii type (d) seems to account for the temperature dependence at low temperatures ($T \lesssim 50~\mathrm{K}$) in the most satisfactory manner.}%
\end{figure} %

In this case, while both types of variable-range hopping models seem to display reasonable linearity, the Efros-Shklovskii type (d) seems to account for the temperature dependence at low temperatures ($T \lesssim 50~\mathrm{K}$) in the most satisfactory manner.

In all cases, the Efros-Shklovskii type variable-range hopping model provides the best fit to the measured data, while the differences between the Mott type and the Efros-Shklovskii type are marginal.

\section{Discussion}
In chapter~\ref{ch:bilayer2018}, we suggested that the negative magnetoresistance observed in topological insulator-insulating ferromagnet bilayers seem to arise from a conduction r\'egime in which localization effects play dominant roles. Indeed, the analyses in this chapter support such conclusion, and suggest that the electric conduction is best described by the variable-range hopping model. The variable-range hopping mode of conduction is, however, not only observed in bilayer samples where negative magnetoresistance occurs, but also in bilayers where the negative magnetoresistance is absence (figures~\ref{fig:models_bl0}~\&~\ref{fig:models_s3}) as well as in the \SI{3}{nm} Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin film without EuS (figure~\ref{fig:models_ti3}). This suggests that variable-range hopping is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the negative magnetoresistance to emerge.

Overall, the Efros-Shklovskii type variable-range hopping model seems to fit the data more closely than the Mott type, although the difference is marginal in some cases. This suggests that the electron-electron interaction observed in the diffusive conduction r\'egime~\cite{Chen2011, Liu2011, Roy2013} persists in the variable-range hopping r\'egime.

In both cases of Bi$_2$Se$_3$--EuS bilayers and (Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_2$Te$_3$--EuS bilayers, as the thicknesses of the TI layer increase, the differences between how well the thermal activation model (and the diffusive model, to a lesser extent), and the variable-range hopping models fit the data seem to decrease. This might be a manifestation of the crossover from the variable-range hopping conduction mode to the diffusive mode as discussed in re.~\cite{liao2015}.

It should be noted that the scalings of temperature, $T^{-1}$, $T^{-1/3}$, and $T^{-1/2}$, give more weight to data points at lower temperatures in their respective plots. Thus the observations above regarding the linearity in the data plots were made only considering a relatively small temperature range: from \SI{2}{K} to a few tens of Kelvins. To ascertain the accuracy of the such observations, further measurements on similar samples at lower temperatures would be helpful.
