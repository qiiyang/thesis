Given the spin-momentum locking in the surface states, the electric conduction in topological insulator thin films is typically discussed in literature in terms of the weak anti-localization effect. While the weak anti-localization explains well the positive magnetoresistance that is ubiquitously observed in topological insulator thin films, two discrepancies have been observed at low temperatures. Firstly, while the weak anti-localization effect should increase the conductivity as the temperature is lowered~\cite{bergmann1984}, often a reduction of conductivity is observed, with the conductivity varies logarithmically with the temperature~\cite{Chen2011, Liu2011, Roy2013} similarly to that described by the weak localization (the opposite) effect (equation~\ref{eq:wl_T}). This has been attributed to the effect of electron-electron interaction in the diffusive r\'egime in two dimensions~\cite{WL_ee}. Secondly, while the weak anti-localization effect is applicable only for low sheet resistance ($R_\Box \ll h/e^2$, see section~\ref{sec:wl}), the resistance of topological insulator thin films sometimes approaches or exceeds the criterion~\cite{TI_WAL_thickness, ZhangJS2011}.

In chapter~\ref{ch:bilayer2018}, such high resistance ($R_\Box \gtrsim h/e^2$) was observed as the commonality amongst TI-ferromagnet thin film bilayers that show negative magnetoresistance (figure~\ref{fig:bilayer2018_wl_trend}). After the publication of \cite{bilayer2018}, we were brought to attention to ref.~\cite{liao2015}, in which \citeauthor{liao2015} analyzed the temperature dependence of resistance of (Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films, demonstrating that by reducing the thicknesses of thin films, electric conduction undergoes a crossover from the diffusive r\'egime with electron-electron interaction to the variable-range hopping r\'egime. These suggest that the temperature dependence of resistance should be analyzed for the thin film samples presented so far in this thesis.

Both topological insulator materials presented in this thesis should be considered doped semiconductors. In the case of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, perfect crystalline samples were predicted to have a Fermi level in the bulk band gap~\cite{TI_electronic_structure_zhang}; whereas as-made thin film samples in practice typically exhibit elevated Fermi levels that intersect with the bulk conduction band, primarily due to interstitials and vacancies~\cite{TI_ARPES1, ARPES_thickness, zhangli2013, Zhanybek3, Fisher2010}. In the case of (Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_2$Te$_3$, on the other hand, the difference between the ionization energy of Bi$^{3+}$ and that of Sb$^{3+}$ is utilized to move the Fermi level into the bulk band gap, typically with Bi$^{3+}$ serving as substitutional dopants~\cite{ZhangJS2011, TI_electronic_structure_zhang}.

The electric conduction modes in doped semiconductors discussed in ref~\cite{schklovskii_efros} and section~\ref{sec:vrh}, therefore, are relevant to the thin film samples in this thesis. Here we will test four conduction models against the temperature dependence of resistance of our samples: the diffusive conduction with electron-electron interaction (EE) as demonstrated in refs.~\cite{Chen2011, Liu2011, Roy2013, liao2015}, both Mott type and Efros-Shklovskii type variable-range hopping (VRH), as well a thermal activation model that might describe the crossover between the variable-range hopping and fully diffusive r\'egimes (equation~\ref{eq:activation}, and ref.~\cite{schklovskii_efros}: chapter 4). The temperature dependence of sheet conductivity resulted from these models in two-dimensions are discussed in section~\ref{sec:vrh}, and summarized below in equations~\ref{eq:modes}:%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:modes}
    \sigma_\Box(T) \propto %
    \begin{cases}
        \log(T / T_0)  & \quad \text{(diffusive with EE, \cite{WL_ee})}\\
        e^{-\frac{\varepsilon_1}{k_B T}}   & \quad \text{(thermal activation, equation~\ref{eq:activation})}\\
        e^{-\left(\frac{T}{T_0}\right)^{-\frac{1}{3}}}   & \quad \text{(Mott type VRH, equation~\ref{eq:vrh_mott})}\\
        e^{-\left(\frac{T}{T_0}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}} & \quad \text{(Efros-Shklovskii type VRH, equation~\ref{eq:vrh_efros})}~.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}%

To test how well each of these models describes the temperature dependence of the thin film samples presented in earlier chapters, the equations~\ref{eq:modes} are linearized into the form $y=ax+b$ (table~\ref{tab:models}), %

and the linearity of the data plots according to each of the models will be compared.

\section{Bi$_2$Se$_3$--EuS Bilayers and Bi$_2$Se$_3$ Thin Films}
The models listed in table~\ref{tab:models} are first compared for the four Bi$_2$Se$_3$--EuS bilayer samples in chapter~\ref{ch:bilayer2014} that showed negative magnetoresistance below the Curie temperature of EuS (figure~\ref{fig:models_bls}). %

    \caption[Conduction model comparison: Bi$_2$Se$_3$--EuS bilayers: BL1--BL3]{\label{fig:models_bls}(Color online) Comparison between conduction models for Bi$_2$Se$_3$--EuS bilayer samples in chapter~\ref{ch:bilayer2014} that showed negative magnetoresistance below the Curie temperature of EuS: (a)~diffusive with electron-electron interaction, (b)~thermal activation, (c)~Mott type variable-range hopping, (e)~Efros-Shklovskii type variable-range hopping.}%
\end{figure}%
%
These samples all have the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ layers around \SI{3}{nm} thick, and showed sheet resistance comparable to the von Klitzing constant at room temperature: $R_\Box(T=300~\mathrm{K}) \sim h/e^2$, and up to two orders of magnitude higher resistance at $T = 2~\mathrm{K}$. Among the four models tested, the diffusive model with electron-electron interaction (figure~\ref{fig:models_bls}a), and the thermal activation model (figure~\ref{fig:models_bls}b) do not display a clear linearity in any significant temperature range. Among the variable-range hopping models (figure~\ref{fig:models_bls}c~\&~d), the Efros-Shklovskii type seems to fit in a wide temperature range $3~\mathrm{K} \lesssim T \lesssim 100~\mathrm{K}$. Below $T \approx 3~\mathrm{K}$, the samples show resistance values that deviate from each other, and from the Efros-Shklovskii model. This is possibly an artefact introduced by inhomogeneity in sample thickness that was discussed in chapter~\ref{ch:bilayer2014}.

In the Bi$_2$Se$_3$--EuS bilayer sample in figure~\ref{fig:TI0_MR}, that has \SI{5}{nm}-thick Bi$_2$Se$_3$ layer, and showed only positive magnetoresistance similarly to a \SI{5}{nm}-thick Bi$_2$Se$_3$ film without EuS, the comparison is less clear (figure~\ref{fig:models_bl0}). %

\end{figure}%
%
Both the thermal activation model (figure~\ref{fig:models_bl0}b) and the Efros-Shklovskii type variable-range hopping (figure~\ref{fig:models_bl0}d) both seem to describe well the low-temperature part of the data ($T \lesssim 30~\mathrm{K}$ and $T \lesssim 10~\mathrm{K}$, respectively).
