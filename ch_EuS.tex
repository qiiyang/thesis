As discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:TI-FM}, an insulating ferromagnet is necessary to implement an experiment to study proximity effects between topological insulators and ferromagnets. Such insulating ferromagnets are often interchangeably referred to as ``ferromagnetic insulators'' or ``ferromagnetic semiconductors''. Among the variety of materials known as ``insulating magnets'', many are ferrimagnets. Examples include magnetite (Fe$_3$O$_4$, $T_C\approx850~\mathrm{K}$)~\cite{Neel1948} and yittrium-iron garnet (``YIG'', Y$_3$Fe$_2$(FeO$_4$)$_3$, $T_C\approx550~\mathrm{K}$)~\cite{YIG}. In such case the net spontaneous magnetization is formed by opposite but unequal magnetic lattices, therefore the surface of these material may consist of multiple opposite magnetic domains, which would complicate the interface to a topological insulator. Insulating true ferromagnets, on the other hand, only have a small number of candidate materials available despite being actively sought after by the Spintronics community \cite[][p.~329]{kittel}~\cite{Yi2014, Wolf2001}. Two of the first well studied insulating ferromagnets are the europium chalcogenides EuO and EuS.

Compounds of europium with elements of the sixth group (O, S, Se, Te) exhibit a rock-salt (NaCl) type crystal structure with ordered magnetic states at low temperatures. As the lattice constant increases from EuO to EuTe, a ferromagnetic ordered state of moments localized on Eu ions appear in EuO ($T_C\approx69~\mathrm{K}$) and in EuS ($T_C\approx16.7~\mathrm{K}$)~\cite{EuO_TC, EuS_Shafer}, while EuSe and EuTe show collinear antiferromagnetic ordering with $T_N\approx4.2~\mathrm{K}$, $T_N\approx9.8~\mathrm{K}$ respectively~\cite{EuSe_AF, EuTe_AF}. In these chalcogenide compounds, the \textit{S} ground state of Eu$^{2+}$ ions and their simple face centered cubic (FCC) magnetic lattice facilitate testing of the Heisenberg model of ferromagnetism and theories of critical phenomena~\cite{divalent_Eu,  EuS_neighbor_exchange, EuS_critical, EuS_neutron, EuS_spin_wave}. A variety of applications were proposed or implemented utilizing these magnetic semiconductors~\cite{EuS_spin_filter, EuS_app1, EuS_spin_filter2}. In addition to the studies presented in this dissertation, a class of these proposed applications, such as $\pi$-Josephson junctions for quantum qubits~\cite{pi_qubit, pi_junction, Jing}, also require fabrication of high-quality insulating ferromagnet thin films with robust magnetic properties.
