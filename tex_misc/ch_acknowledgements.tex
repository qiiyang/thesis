Sir Isaac Newton famously wrote: ``If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.'' No matter if there will be a day when I can, with credibility and confidence, claim clairvoyance, however minute it might be, I ought to thank the giants that were all around me during graduate school.

My advisor, Prof. Aharon Kapitulnik, has inspired me, and will continue to inspire, not only with his knowledge and dedication, but also with almost Beethovenian passion and sincerity, both for science and for life, that I did not think was possible to be possessed by a person in real life, let alone someone outside the artistic professions.

Aharon is a member of the professorial tripartite that, according to legend, was introduced to Mikhail Gorbachev during his visit as the ``KGB of the West''. The other two members, Theodore (Ted) Geballe and Malcolm (Mac) Beasley, being more senior, became emeriti prior to or during my time here. They have continued their dedication to science, as well as fostering us the new generations. Thanks to them, we have had glimpses of the arts of humor, diplomacy, and competent leadership, and I was convinced that there is much more to look forward to in life, other than the confusing twenties that I came to the graduate school with, and now leave without.

I hope that one day, if good fortunes continue to favor me, I may find in myself traces of the wisdom that is emanated continuously from Aharon, Ted, and Mac.

I was incredibly fortunate to be supervised and mentored by Dr. Merav Dolev when I first arrived. She is a brilliant scientist, and an even better teacher. Every time I have mentored younger students myself since then, I was reminded of her by my own conscience: have I done my best for them to emulate what she for me; will I ever live up to her example?

Merav, however, is not the only colleague that I have benefited greatly from. All the students, postdocs, and members of research staff in the KGB group have been the most helpful through out my time here. They are not only excellent collaborators in research, but also wonderful companions to develop an intellectual maturity with. If one day I will achieve what Oscar Wilde would call the ``Oxford temper'', and become someone who is capable of playing gracefully with ideas, it would be, in no small part, thank to the numerous discussions and debates that my colleagues indulged me with.

I also ought to thank my collaborators outside the KGB group. Particularly, Prof. Alexander (Alik) Palevski at Tel Aviv University, Israel, Prof. Ian Fisher and his student, now Prof. Jiun-Haw Chu. The skills and knowledge I learned from them will undoubtedly continue to benefit me through out my career.

Sir Isaac's saying regarding the shoulders of giants would not have its lasting fame unless it reflects a general truth that applies to a broad context. Indeed, the same truth was echoed a century later by his compatriot, Edmund Burke, who pointed out that we are indebted to not just responsible to those who are with us, but also those who came before us. On this note, I would like to thank my grandparents, three of whom are no longer with us (may they rest in peace). They survived wars and famines that our generation could only imagine, yet never showed resentment or nihilism. They came from all walks of life: destitute and wealthy, illiterate and learned; and were united by

Part of the data presented in this thesis is resulted from collaborated experiments. The pulsed laser deposition (PLD) recipe for Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin films was developed together with Li Zhang. The PLD targets for EuS and Bi$_2$Se$_3$ were fabricated at the University of California, Davis, by Jinfeng Zhao and Subhash H. Risbud. Polar Kerr effect measurements by Sagnac interferometry were performed and analyzed by Elisabeth Schemm and Alexander Fried. Transmission electron microscopy was performed by Ann F. Marshall as part of a training demonstration.

Sample fabrication and characterization were partly performed at the Stanford Nano Shared Facilities (SNSF), supported by the National Science Foundation under award ECCS-1542152.
