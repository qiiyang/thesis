Sir Isaac Newton famously wrote: ``If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.'' No matter whether there will be a day when I can, with credibility and confidence, claim clairvoyance, however minute it might be, I undoubtedly ought to thank the giants that were all around me during graduate school.

Dr. Merav Dolev, who supervised and mentored me in this lab when I first arrived, is a brilliant scientist, and an even better teacher. Every time I have mentored younger students myself, I was reminded of her: have I done my best for them to emulate what she for me; will I ever live up to her example?

My advisor, Prof. Aharon Kapitulnik, has inspired me, and will continue to inspire, not only with his knowledge and dedication, but also with almost Beethovenian passion and sincerity, both for science and for life, that I did not think was possible to be possessed by a person in real life, let alone a person outside the artistic professions.

Prof. Theodore Geballe, the most senior member of the KGB (Kapitulnik-Geballe-Beasley) group, emanates gracious wisdom wherever he goes. He 

\paragraph{}Part of the data presented in this thesis is resulted from collaborated experiments. The pulsed laser deposition (PLD) recipe for Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin films was developed together with Li Zhang. The PLD targets for EuS and Bi$_2$Se$_3$ were fabricated at the University of California, Davis, by Jinfeng Zhao and Subhash H. Risbud. Polar Kerr effect measurements by Sagnac interferometry were performed and analyzed by Elisabeth Schemm and Alexander Fried. Transmission electron microscopy was performed by Ann F. Marshall as part of a training demonstration.

Sample fabrication and characterization were partly performed at the Stanford Nano Shared Facilities (SNSF), supported by the National Science Foundation under award ECCS-1542152.
