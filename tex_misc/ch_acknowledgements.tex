Part of the data presented in this thesis is resulted from collaborated experiments. The pulsed laser deposition (PLD) recipe for Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin films was developed together with Li Zhang. The PLD targets for EuS and Bi$_2$Se$_3$ were fabricated at the University of California, Davis, by Jinfeng Zhao and Subhash H. Risbud. Polar Kerr effect measurements by Sagnac interferometry were performed and analyzed by Elisabeth Schemm and Alexander Fried. Transmission electron microscopy was performed by Ann F. Marshall as part of a training demonstration.

Sample fabrication and characterization were partly performed at the Stanford Nano Shared Facilities (SNSF), supported by the National Science Foundation under award ECCS-1542152.
