The magnetization $\vec{M}$ of a material and a constant applied magnetic field strength $\vec{H}$ are connected through its DC magnetic susceptibility:
\begin{equation}%
    \vec{M} = \chi\vec{H}~.%
\end{equation}%
%
In general, since $\vec{M}$ may have different direction from $\vec{H}$, $\chi$ is a tensor. Within the scope of this thesis, however, only the component of $\vec{M}$ that is parallel to $\vec{H}$ is measured, therefore $\vec{H}$, $\vec{M}$, and $\chi$ are effectively all treated as scalars:
\begin{equation}%
    M = \chi{}H~.%
\end{equation}%
%
The DC magnetic susceptibility of a sample, therefore, can simply be calculated by the measured magnetic moment (e.g., with a SQUID magnetometer) and the applied magnetic field strength.

When the applied magnetic field strength contains a constant component $\overline{H}$ and a sinusoidal component $\widetilde{H}(t)=\left|\widetilde{H}\right|e^{i\omega{}t}$, the magnetization generally also displays an oscillating component in response: $M(t) = \overline{M} + \widetilde{M}(t)$. Similarly to the DC magnetic susceptibility, the oscillating components of the the magnetization and of the applied field strength are in turn related by the AC magnetic susceptibility $\chi_{AC}$:
\begin{equation}%
    \widetilde{M}(t) = \chi_{AC}\widetilde{H}(t)~.%
\end{equation}%

When the oscillating field $\widetilde{H}(t)$ has a small amplitude and a low frequency, the AC susceptibility takes real values and measures the local derivative of $\overline{M}$ with respect to $\overline{H}$:%
\begin{equation}%
    \lim\limits_{\omega \to 0}\chi_{AC} = \frac{\diff\overline{M}}{\diff\overline{H}}~.%
\end{equation}%
%
On the other hand, at higher frequencies, the dynamic properties of the sample plays an important role, and the magnetization may respond to the applied field in a partially out-of-sync manner. In such case, the AC susceptibility takes a complex form:%
\begin{equation}%
    \chi_{AC} = \chi' + i\chi''~,%
\end{equation}%
where $\chi'$ and $\chi''$ take real values. These are often referred to as the dynamic magnetic susceptibility.

Consider the work done to the local magnetization by the applied external magnetic field, the complex power per unit volume is%
\begin{align}%
    \widetilde{P} &= \frac{1}{2}\mu_0 \widetilde{H}^* \frac{\diff \widetilde{M}}{\diff t}\nonumber\\
        &= \frac{1}{2}\mu_0\chi_{AC}\widetilde{H}^*\frac{\diff \widetilde{H}}{\diff t}\nonumber\\
        &= \frac{1}{2}i\omega\mu_0\chi_{AC}\left|\widetilde{H}\right|^2\nonumber\\
        &= \frac{1}{2}\omega\mu_0\left|\widetilde{H}\right|^2(-\chi''+i\chi')\label{eq:acm_power}~.
\end{align}%
The real part of $\widetilde{P}$, corresponding to dissipation, is determined by $\chi''$; whereas the imaginary part of $\widetilde{P}$, corresponding to the reflection of electromagnetic waves, is detwemined by $\chi'$.


A home-made mutual inductance device (figure~\ref{fig:mi_sketch}) was used to measure the AC susceptibility in thin film samples.\footnote{The mutual inductance device was fabricated by Alan Fang.} %
