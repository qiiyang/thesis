A Josephson's junction is two pieces of superconductors separated by a thin barrier that is either an insulator or a normal conductor (figure~\ref{fig:josephson}). %

%
When the barrier is sufficiently thin, the supercurrent tunnels through the barrier, thereby the junction can sustain a constant current without applied voltage. This is referred to as the Josephson effect. The voltage across the junction, $V$, the current tunneling through the barrier, $I$, are related to the the difference between the phases of the Ginzburg-Landau order parameters on the two sides of the barrier $\Delta\theta$~\cite{Josephson1962, Josephson1974}:%
\begin{align}
    V(t) &= \frac{\hbar}{2e}\frac{\diff \Delta\theta(t)}{\diff t}~,\\
    I(t) &= I_c\sin\left(\Delta\theta(0) + \frac{2eV}{\hbar}t\right)~.\label{eq:Josephson_I}
\end{align}%
The current constant $T_c$ is referred to as the critical current, namely the maximal current can pass through the junction without an applied voltage.

A Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) is two Josephson's junctions connected by a superconductor in parallel (figure~\ref{fig:squid}). %

\end{figure}%
%
In an ideal SQUID, the geometry is perfectly symmetrical, therefore the critical currents of the two junctions the same, and the barriers do not introduce any dissipation. An external magnetic flux $\Phi$ through the SQUID loop introduces a difference between the phase differences of the two junctions~\cite{Annett}:%
\begin{align}
    \Delta\theta_1 - \Delta\theta_2 &= \frac{2e}{\hbar}\Phi\nonumber\\
        &= 2\pi\frac{\Phi}{\Phi_0}~,\label{eq:SQUID}
\end{align}%
where $\Phi_0 = \frac{h}{2e}$ is the magnetic flux quantum. Equations~\ref{eq:Josephson_I}~\&~\ref{eq:SQUID} together illustrate that the combined supercurrent $I$ as a function of the external magnetic flux $\Phi$ is a Fraunhoffer interference pattern formed by the superposition of the supercurrents through both junctions.
