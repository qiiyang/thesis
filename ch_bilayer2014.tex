At the conclusion of the experiments presented in this chapter and the publication of ref.~\cite{bilayer2014}, probably the most extensively studied 3D-TI hasd been bismuth-selenide (Bi$_2$Se$_3$)~\cite{TI_electronic_structure_zhang, Zhanybek3, TI_other1}, exhibiting crystal structure that consists of atomic quintuple layers (QLs), with three QLs forming a unit cell. As made, uncompensated samples typically have a Fermi level above the Dirac point and intersecting the bulk conduction band~\cite{TI_ARPES1, ARPES_thickness}. In particular, low temperature transport measurements on ungated and uncompensated TI films show positive magnetoresistance (MR) at low magnetic fields and in a wide range of film thicknesses~\cite{ TI_WAL_Hongkong, TI_WAL_thickness, zhangli2012}. This was explained in terms of weak antilocalization (WAL) that results from spin-momentum locking on the surface state Dirac cone~\cite{TI_WAL_Hongkong, WL_theory}. While the inability to account for the bulk bands (presumably because of their low mobility) has challenged this simple assignment, the discovery of weak localization (WL) effects at higher fields~\cite{zhangli2013} and the ability to accurately separate quantum oscillation effects~\cite{Ando_PRL} in high-quality films may provide a first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of transport in these systems.

In this chapter, procedure of pulsed laser deposition of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ on EuS~(100) and Al$_2$O$_3$~(0001) are described, and magneto-transport measurement results are presented, demonstrating a negative magnetoresistance that emerges below the Curie temperature of EuS, in contrast to the ubiquitously observed positive magnetoresistance in topological insulator thin films.

\section{Sample Fabrication and Characterization}\label{sec:bilayer2014_char}
All bilayer (BL) samples presented in this chapter were grown using a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. For the bottom layer, EuS thin films of thicknesses 20--200nm were grown on Al$_2$O$_3$ (0001) using the optimal growth procedure outlined in chapter~\ref{ch:EuS}. Titanium Ohmic contacts were subsequently evaporated {\it ex situ} on each EuS thin film through a shadow mask. Electric insulation ($R_\Box > 20~\mathrm{M\Omega}$) was verified for $2~\mathrm{K}<T<300~\mathrm{K}$. Finally, the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ layer was deposited, overlapping with the titanium contacts at their inner corners, forming a van der Pauw configuration (fig.~\ref{fig:bl2014_sketch}).%

Similarly to the EuS target in section~\ref{sec:EuSPLD}, PLD targets of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ were prepared by SPS~\cite{Jinfeng2, Subhash1},\footnote{Target preparation was carried out by Jinfeng Zhao and Subhash H. Risbud at the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of California, Davis.}\footnote{PLD recipe for Bi$_2$Se$_3$ was developed together with Li Zhang.} and the target surface was similarly polished with a 800~grit diamond sandpaper before transferring to the vacuum chamber. Unlike EuS, the plasma plumes generated by ablating Bi$_2$Se$_3$ in high vacuum are narrow in comparison to the substrate size ($\sim$5~mm). To diffuse the plasma plumes and to prevent potential oxidation from residual gases, 200~millitorr of argon gas mixed with 2\% hydrogen was introduced after pumping to $10^{-6}$ high vacuum. For final target surface treatment and to deposit the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin films, the target was ablated by a 25~ns 248~nm KrF excimer pulsed laser beam at 5~Hz repetition rate and 0.54~$\mathrm{J\cdot{}cm^{-2}}$ fluence, while spinning at 18 rpm. Bare Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) substrates or that with previously deposited EuS were heated to $\SI{150}{\degreeCelsius}$ $\SI{5}{cm}$ away from the target. The growth rate was estimated to be 0.15~\AA{} per pulse.

To compensate for selenium deficiencies that are typical for as-grown Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin films \cite{Zhanybek3, zhangli2012, zhangli2013, TI_ARPES1, ARPES_thickness}, a selenium capping layer was deposited immediately following the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ layer, by ablating a selenium sputtering target (Kurt J. Lesker, 99.999\% pure) for 300 pulses. The sample was annealed with the capping layer at $\SI{150}{\degreeCelsius}$ for around 15 minutes before the heater was switched off. When the sample was cooled to below $\SI{80}{\degreeCelsius}$, an additional selenium capping layer was applied before venting to prevent exposure to air.

The cross-section transmission electron micrographs (fig.~\ref{fig:bl2014_TEM}) indicate smooth interface and excellent layering of the Bi$_2$Se$_3$. While the brightness is heightened at the interface in fig.~\ref{fig:bl2014_TEM}, individual atoms are still discernable when the micrograph is presented in digital format. Such heightened brightness is likely artefact resulted from the preparation of the cross section, which involves mechanical polishing followed by argon ion milling. Very different mechanical properties of EuS (cubic lattice) and Bi$_2$Se$_3$ (layers weakly bound by van der Waals force) likely result in different response to mechanical polishing, which might be further compounded by different etching rate during ion milling. Similar heightened brightness is observed at the interface between EuS and Al$_2$O$_3$ to a lesser extent (sec.~\ref{sec:EuSPLD}, fig.~\ref{fig:EuS_AFM}).
